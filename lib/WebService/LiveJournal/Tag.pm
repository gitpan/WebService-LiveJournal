version 0.07

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use WebService::LiveJournal;
 my $client = WebService::LiveJournal->new( ... );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Instances of this class represent LiveJournal tags.  They can
be fetched from the LiveJournal server using the C<get_user_tags>
client method.  That method takes one optional argument, which
is the journal to use.  If the journal name is not specified
then it will use the logged in user's journal.

this value set to off are still usable, they're just not exposed to S2.

'private', 'friends', or 'group'.
